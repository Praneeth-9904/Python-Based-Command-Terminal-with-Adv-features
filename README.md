**Python-Based Advanced Command Terminal**
**Description**

This project is a fully functional Python terminal that replicates the behavior of a real system terminal. It supports file and directory operations (ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, rm), system monitoring (cpu, mem, ps), command history, tab completion, and AI-driven natural language commands. Users can type commands like "create a folder called test" or "move file1.txt into demo," which are interpreted and executed by the terminal.

Developed in Python using modules like os, subprocess, psutil, shlex, and readline, the project demonstrates both traditional terminal functionality and modern AI integration. It is responsive, extensible, and designed for efficiency.

**Features**

File & Directory Operations: ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, rm

System Monitoring: CPU usage, memory usage, running processes

AI Interpreter: Converts natural language commands into executable actions

Command History & Auto-Completion: Use arrow keys and Tab for easier navigation

Error Handling: Graceful feedback for invalid commands or missing files/folders

**Installation**

**Clone the repository:**

git clone <repository_url>


**Navigate to the project folder:**

cd PyTerminal


**Install dependencies:**

pip install psutil

**Usage**

**Run the terminal using:**

python pyterminal.py


**Type help to see all available commands.

Try AI commands:**

ai create folder called demo
ai move file1.txt into demo


Use history to see previous commands.

Use cd .. to go up a directory.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x

Modules: os, subprocess, psutil, shlex, readline

Optional: VS Code with CodeMate Build & Extension for AI-assisted development

**Future Enhancements**

Expand AI interpreter for more natural language commands.

Web-based GUI version of the terminal.

Enhanced process management and advanced system commands.

**License**

This project is open-source and free to use.
